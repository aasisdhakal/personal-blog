Maintaining a healthy Kubernetes (K8s) cluster is akin to caring for a garden. You nurture it, watch it grow, and ensure it thrives. Similar to tending to a garden‚Äôs needs, a K8s cluster demands attention and care. **Prometheus**, an open-source toolkit, acts as a vigilant caretaker for your K8s environment.

Just like a garden can suffer if pests aren‚Äôt kept in check, your Kubernetes cluster might encounter challenges such as **resource constraints**, **network issues**, **scheduling problems**, or **storage issues**‚Äîall silently brewing disruptions that could potentially impact your business, all while remaining undetected.

## üåü What is Prometheus and Why Use It?

Prometheus functions like a watchful guardian, continuously collecting data (**metrics**) from your cluster‚Äôs various elements such as **nodes**, **pods**, and **services**. It stores this data in its own database, ready for analysis, visualization, and alerting.

Think of it as a **comprehensive report** on your K8s cluster‚Äôs condition. It allows you to track:

- CPU and memory usage
- Network traffic
- Request latency
- And more...

### üõ† Prometheus helps you:

- Spot potential issues early (e.g., Resource Utilization, Network Congestion, Persistent Errors)
- Understand your cluster‚Äôs performance and resource usage
- Make informed decisions about scaling and optimization
- Receive timely alerts via Slack or other channels for critical issues

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Does Prometheus Work?

Prometheus uses a **pull-based model**, retrieving metrics through HTTP endpoints from:

- Kubernetes components
- Exporters like Node Exporter & cAdvisor

### üìä Node Exporter

Gathers **system-level metrics** from Kubernetes nodes (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network).
_Analogy: The kitchen manager checking oven temps, ingredient stocks, and how busy the kitchen is._

### üì¶ cAdvisor (Container Advisor)

Collects **container-level metrics** (CPU, memory usage, disk I/O).
_Analogy: The sous-chef focusing on individual dishes, monitoring their progress and quality._

## üîÑ Workflow: Prometheus + AlertManager

Once data is gathered, you can use **PromQL** to query it. Visualize this data using **Grafana** dashboards.

Grafana acts like the **head chef‚Äôs tablet**, making everything easy to understand at a glance ‚Äî metrics from Node Exporter and cAdvisor are presented in a clear, visual format.

## üöÄ Implementation Guide

Let‚Äôs install Prometheus using **Helm**, the package manager for Kubernetes.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Helm

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 > get_helm.sh
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add the Bitnami Chart Repository

Next, we‚Äôll add the Bitnami chart repository to Helm

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Monitoring Namespace

Next, we‚Äôll add the Bitnami chart repository to Helm

```bash
kubectl create namespace monitoring
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Switch to the Monitoring Namespace

Switch to the newly created namespace for subsequent operations:

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Install Prometheus:

Finally, use Helm to install the **kube-prometheus** chart, it comes with default components like node exporter, black-box exporter, and kube metrics.

```bash
helm install prometheus oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/kube-prometheus

```

## Bonus: Set Up AlertManager Slack Integration

To ensure timely notifications, we‚Äôve established predefined alert rules. When these criteria are met, alerts are routed through AlertManager to Slack for immediate attention.
For more alerting guidelines, refer to the additional rules available [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/aasisdhakal/4e727a1622c94c05e81a7e70e07a728c/raw/26b5083a111d8185900701ffbe9d0f51f9073616/prometheus-rules.yaml).

### Deploy the Alert Rules üöÄ

```bash
curl -sL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/aasisdhakal/4e727a1622c94c05e81a7e70e07a728c/raw/26b5083a111d8185900701ffbe9d0f51f9073616/prometheus-rules.yaml \
  | kubectl create -f -
```

### Verify the Alert Rules üîç

Initiate port forwarding and check the alert section to see the list of alerts:

```bash
kubectl port-forward --namespace monitoring svc/prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus 9090:9090
```

### Update AlertManager Config üîß

1. Download the alertmanager-config.yaml file and add your Slack API key and channel name.

2. Encode the file and copy the value:

```bash
base64 -w 0 alertmanager-config.yaml
```

3. Edit the Secrets and replace alertmanager.yaml value with the encoded value:

```bash
kubectl edit secret alertmanager-prometheus-kube-prometheus-alertmanager -n monitoring
```

After making these adjustments, anticipate prompt alerts. Whenever the defined rules are triggered, messages will be dispatched to the AlertManager.

## Conclusion üå±

By implementing Prometheus and AlertManager, you‚Äôve transformed your K8s cluster into a well-monitored garden, blooming with insights and proactive notifications. You can identify potential issues early, optimize resource utilization, and ensure smooth operation‚Äîall while keeping your business flourishing.

Embrace the power of Prometheus and AlertManager, and watch your K8s cluster thrive!
